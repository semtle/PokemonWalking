DEBUG (NewDialogue.java): Needs testing to see if there's any problem with	NewDialogue.
DEBUG (MainComponent.java): Uncomment this line if you feel debugging and switching window focus from IDE to game and back is nauseous.
TODO (11/24/2014) (WorldConstants.java): Make map more flexible by allowing scripting files of different filenames to be loaded. Not sure where it was being loaded.
TODO (6/18/2015) (Area.java): Door needs to be checked for null areas. If null areas are found, default to locked doors.

TODO (6/19/2015) (WorldConstants.java): Check to see why there's a need to load "aas.script".
TODO (6/19/2015) (PixelData.java): Make the borders a bit more thicker. Possibly the land border near the edges of the water tiles.
TODO: (2014-6-26) (ScriptEditor.java): Add the ability to save temp script data on the fly. Closing included.
TODO (OverWorld.java): Add a method that executes according to the sector ID.
